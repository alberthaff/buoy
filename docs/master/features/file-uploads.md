# File uploads

With Buoy, you can upload files to your backend through a mutation.
Just define the variables to contain the files your want to upload.
Supported types are [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
[`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList) and
[`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob).
